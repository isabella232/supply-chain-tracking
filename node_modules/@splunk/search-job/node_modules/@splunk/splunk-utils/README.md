# @splunk/splunk-utils

A collection of utilities for working with Splunk Enterprise.

## Install

Install the package:
```
npm install @splunk/splunk-utils
```

## IE11 and Safari support

`@splunk/splunk-utils` relies on `window.fetch` and `window.Promise`. IE11 requires a polyfill
for both. Safari 10.0 and earlier require a polyfill for fetch. `@splunk/splunk-utils` doesn't
include or load any polyfills.

To support these browsers, check that polyfills such as [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)
and [promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill) are included as a part
of your build.
